[Webdriver](https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/webdriver/)
### Getting Started
Selenium supports automation of all the major browsers in the market.
Webdriver is **an API** and **protocol** that defines a language-neutral interface.
Each browser is backed by a specific WebDriver implementation, called a driver.

### Elements
#### Finders
```python
vegetale = driver.find_element(By.CLASS_NAME,'tomatoes')
```
